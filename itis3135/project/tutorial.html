                  Hey! This web app gets all its data from using the
                  <strong>Flickr API.</strong> If you want to learn how to use
                  this template and what you need in your Flickr account, please

                  Flickr will hold all of your user information, pictures, links,
                  and liked photos. I reccomend
                  <a href="https://www.cleverbox.co.uk/blog/top-tips/set-flickr-account/">
                    creating an account
                  </a>
                  and looking around before continuing.

                Below is a list of all aspects of Flickr that the web app makes
                use of:

              <p>
                Please note that the above are requirements for the page, and
                things will be missing from your pages if left absent. At least
                one Album and one Collection is reccomended to make first. A
                photo with the tag &quot;background&quot; is necessary to have
                the main page&#39;s background, the page will pick one randomly
                on each load.

              <h3>How to change Flickr information</h3>
              <div>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You can access the settings by first clicking <em>You</em>,
                    then <em>About</em> on your Flickr homescreen once signed in.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Here you can change your:
                    <ul>
                      <li><em>Real Name</em></li>
                      <li><em>Profile Description</em></li>
                      <li><em>Outside Links/ Social Medias</em></li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <h3>
                After setting up your information, the next step is
                <em>Photos!</em>
              </h3>
              <div>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  You can click the cloud icon on the top right of your page to
                  upload photos
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Keep in mind:
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Galleries tend to look best with themes or aesthetics
                          in mind
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          While you can put as little or many photos as you
                          like, 5-10 is reccomended per album
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Choose your page backgrounds
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      In the <em>Photostream</em> section, click any photo you
                      think would look good large
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Scroll down until you find the <em>Tags</em> and add a tag
                      with the text: <strong>background</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      That photo will now be the pool of backgrounds that the
                      web app will randomly select on each load
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          If you would like only one background, only add a
                          <strong>background</strong> tag to one photo
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Heading back to your <em>Photostream</em>, find a photo you
                  want in an album and hover over the image
                </li>
                <li>
                  An <em>Add to: Album</em> pop up should appear, where you can
                  create a new album or add to an existing one
                  <ul>
                    <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  After making your albums, you can view them by clicking on the

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Here you can change the <em>Cover Photo</em>, to pick
                      which image shows as the cover for the gallery on the web
                      app

                These are under the <em>photos I like</em> section on the web

                <li>
                  Once you find some, repeat the process from making an

                <li>
                  These will hold photos you like from other people, but you

              <h3>How it works</h3>
              <div>
              <p>
                To use this template with your own Flickr account and
                information, you will need to find your user id and to get an
                API key
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To find this, go to your <em>Photostream</em>, once there, it
                  will be the entire text in the url of the page between the
                  last two slashes
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Example from my account: flickr.<span
                      ></span>com/photos/192658515@N08/
                    </li>
                    <li>My user id would be <strong>192658515@N08</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Next is to get your very own Flickr API key from
                  <a
                    href="https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/noncommercial/?"
                    >here</a
                  >
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Now just replacing the current API key and user id varibles in
                the profile.js in the scripts folder is all that is needed to
                make your information shine on your web app
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>How to hide this page</h3>
              <div>
              <p>
                To hide this page for deployment, simply remove it from the <em>header</em> component, 
                it is labled as "tutorial" in an &lta&gt tag.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                All that's left is to enjoy!
