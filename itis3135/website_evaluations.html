            <h3>Van Gogh Exhibit Charlotte</h3>
          </a>
            <p>
              This nice looking site is for a Van Gogh immersive exhibit here in Charlotte, NC. 
              It is a simple website with the purpse of selling tickets for the exhibit as well 
              as advertise and have info for events and activities to do at the exhibit, and a 
              good example of a page following the CRAP principles.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Contrast: This page has consistent and easy to read contrast for it's visuals 
                and text. It's colors for each section alter between light and dark backgrounds, 
                which help to break up sections of the site at the expense of being slightly 
                blinding. 
              </li>
              <li>Repetition: The layout and lists of information on this page are repeated in 
                different forms of cards, which help the reader understand and know what to expect. 
              </li>
              <li>Alignment: This site makes great use of negative space, through the use of images 
                relating to the content being advertised. Every element is aligned and connected with 
                similar elements, and everything feels like it makes sense with where it is on the 
                page.
              </li>
              <li>Proximity: This page is pretty responsive and readable on a phone and on a big 
                screen, thanks to its centered approach with seperates bodies vertically, 
                displaying as many elements horizontally in each body as readable for the screen 
                width. There is an acceptable amount of space between elements that enhance it 
                visually.</li>

          <h3>YALE SCHOOL Â­OF ART</h3>
        </a>
          <p>
            This site is the main page page for the Yale School of Art, and has an index with 
            places for students and faculty. It is an example of a poorly designed website in 
            reference to the CRAP principles. It is designed by students and every student has 
            access to be able to edit the style for the site.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Contrast: The color on this site is not cohesive, with stark differences in levels 
              of contrast that go from blinding like in the headings, to messy with how the lower 
              headings for the newsletters that blend in with the background.
            </li>
            <li>Repetition: This website does have repetition, just not in the pleasing to the 
              eyes way. The background gradients repeat for multiple sections, as does the gif 
              used for the background. </li>
            <li>Alignment: The page is skewed to the left of center, with a shortr side bar with 
              links and two columns to right that go to the bottom of the page. The heights of 
              the bodys in the columns are not aligned and many are mismatched.</li>
            <li>Proximity: This site page is filled with text that is hard to read, and many links
              to information and related sites in different places. This is expected as the site 
              has many purposes and editors.
            </li>
